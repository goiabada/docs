## Welcome to Goiabada Docs!

Here you can find all the documentation that we have written regarding all the phases of the **Goiaba** project. If our adventurous souls wish to reproduce another video games hardware with microcontrollers in the future, we'll probably format this whole thing and add a separate section for each one.

Our first and currently running project is [Goiaba](https://github.com/goiabada/goiaba), a hardware  GBA reproduction using low-cost microcontrollers. All the necessary code can/will be found at the public repository.

You can find more about the specifics in one of the sections below:

1. [GBA Overview](https://goiabada.github.io/docs/sections/overview/index)
2. [GBA Memory Information](https://goiabada.github.io/docs/sections/memory/index)
3. [GBA I/O Mapping](https://goiabada.github.io/docs/sections/io/map)
