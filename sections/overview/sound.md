## The Sound System

- Comprises four FM synthesis channels for generating sound effects and music, primarly for backward compatibility
- Features two 16-bit stereo digital sound channels
  - Capable of outputting sampled sound effects and music tracks
- There is no built-in sound mixer for synchronous sound playback
  - Meaning the developers must write their own sound mixers or use a third-party library

> A sound mixer allows multiple sounds to be played at once
> Without a mixer, it's only possible to reproduce one sound at a time, called **async playback**
